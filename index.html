        <p class="about_text">
            I am an ambitious Computer Science student in Trinity College Dublin with professional experience as a
            Software Development Engineering Intern at Amazon Web Services (AWS).<br/><br/>
            Studying Computer Science has allowed me to marry my interests in technology, problem-solving and
            innovation. I am particularly interested in pursuing a career in machine learning in the future and
            I have completed many software engineering projects in my spare time.<br/><br/>
            I was selected as on of 36 Naughton Foundation scholars nationwide in 2018. This scholarship is awarded
            on the basis of demonstrated leadership skills and academic success in the Leaving Certificate. The
            Naughton foundation scholarship was established to encourage young people to enter the STEM field in
            universities throughout Ireland.<br/><br/>
            In 2017, I won the National Rotary Youth Leadership Development Competition. This competition recognises
            leadership potential in young people and is conducted through a series of intense interviews, covering
            topics such as immigration and climate change. In the same year, I served as an Irish Youth Delegate
            to the European Parliament at a Euroscola event, where I was elected spokesperson for Climate Action
            and Green Energy.

            <p>Good knowledge of data structures and algorithms is the foundation of writing impressive code. Achieving
                99% in my Algorithms and Data Structures module in college is a testament to my ability to write
                efficient code using appropriate algorithms and data structures.<br/><br/>
                I have experience with algorithm design techniques and analysis, as well as working with complex
                data structures to create scalable applications that can process large amounts of data quickly.

            <h3 class="skill_title"><strong>Creative Problem Solving</strong></h3>
            <p>I pride myself on my ability to compartmentalise all aspects of a problem before attempting a solution.
                This problem solving technique deepens my understanding of an issue before tackling it
                and gives allows me to plan a solution effectively.<br/><br/>
                I endeavour to create permanent solutions rather than temporary ones and I have experience leading
                software engineering teams in college to tackle issues in this manner.

            <h3 class="skill_title"><strong>Machine Learning & Data Science</strong></h3>
            <p>My university does not offer any modules in these areas until final year. I simply cannot wait that
                long, so I have been teaching myself as much as I can about this exciting area of Computer Science
                in my spare time.<br/><br/>
                I have experience using regression analysis, k-nearest neighbours and k-means clustering to analyse
                data sets. I have also used NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) in some side projects.

                        In my pursuit of teaching myself machine learning, I decided to create this project. This
                        project uses NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) to train AI clients to play a clone
                        of the game Flappy Bird.<br/><br/>
                        On simple tasks, the NEAT algorithm often arrives at effective networks more
                        quickly than other contemporary neuro-evolutionary techniques and reinforcement learning
                        modules.<br/><br/>
                        This project is written in Python and uses the pygame module to recreate the Flappy bird game
                        environment. The AI client uses the python-neat module to create neural networks that play the
                        game.

                        After completing my Algorithms and Data Structures module in college, I wanted to deepen
                        my understanding of the algorithms that we had studied. I also wanted to explore new front-end
                        technologies that are not covered in my university, to broaden my web-development skills.
                        Making this sorting visualiser allowed me to kill both of those birds with the one
                        stone!<br/><br/>
                        This project was my first venture into the React.js framework. This responsive web application
                        allow users to visualise six sorting algorithms: Quick sort, Merge sort, Tim sort, Insertion
                        sort, Selection sort and Bubble sort. Please check this project out to see how the different
                        sorting algorithms work!

                        I have been obsessed with Rubik's cubes ever since I was a child. My record is around 19
                        seconds for a single solve. It is not always practical to bring a Rubik's cube around with me,
                        so I decided to make a digital one that I will always have on my laptop!<br/><br/>
                        This project uses Processing, a programming language that is based on Java syntax with a focus
                        on visualisation. This project allows users to scramble the cube and attempt to solve it
                        themselves.
                        If they ever get stuck, they can just press the space bar and watch the puzzle solve itself
                        before their very eyes.

                        college. I received a grade of 98% on this VHDL project. This assignment simulates a microcoded
                        instruction set processor that can perform arithmetic, logic and shifting operations as well as
                        conditional and unconditional branching.<br/><br/>
                        The processor reads user-provided machine code from memory. All of the components that I created
                        in this project have test-benches that ensure that their functionality is correct.
