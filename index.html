          <p>Receiving a final mark of 99% in my Algorothms and Data Structures module in college is a testament to my ability to work with complex algorithms and data strucutres. I always endeavour to use efficient programming techniques and useful data structures to bring my code to the next level.</p>

      <div class="about-me_body">
        <p>Studying computer science has allowed me to marry my interests in technology, problem-solving and innovation. I am particularly interested in pursuing a career in machine learning in the future and I have completed many programming projects and competitions to gain experience in the field of software engineering.</p>
        <p>I was chosen as a recipient of the Naughton Foundation Scholarship in 2018 because my Leaving Certificate results placed me in the top 0.01% of students in Ireland. This academic success has followed me into college where I won the Book Prize for my results in my Junior Freshman Year and placed sixth in my class of over one hundred students. </p>
        <p>In 2017, I won the National Rotary Youth Leadership Development Competition. This competition recognizes leadership potential in young people and is conducted through a series of intense interviews, covering topics such as immigration and climate change. In the same year, I served as an Irish Youth Delegate to the European Parliament where I was elected spokesperson for Climate Action and Green Energy.</p>

          <p>Netsoc came up with idea of providing containerised webspaces for their members. Instead of being limited to HTML and maybe PHP and MySQL, users would have full root access to their container and be able to choose their server operating system and develop their site using any framework they would like.</p>
          <p>I contributed to the front-end portion of the project, using Python Flask and VueJS to create a user interface that allows Netsoc members to manage their containers.</p>

            <p>This repository is a collection of the data science and machine learning projects that I have completed in my spare time. Data science and machine learning are fields that I find extremely interesting. Unfortunately, Trinity College Dublin doesn't provide any modules in these areas until final year. In this regard, I am eager to teach myself as much as I can about these topics, as I simply cannot wait until then!</p>

          <div class="project_body">
            <p>OpenFlow is a communication protocol that allows a server to tell network switches where to send packets. In a conventional network, each switch has propietary software that tells it what to do. With OpenFlow, the packet-moving decisions are centralized, so that the network can be programmed independently of the individual switches and data center gear.</p>
            <p>I received 105% on this implementation with extra credit, as I implemented Dijkstra's algorithm to route packets across a network of switches.</p>

          <div class="project_body">
            <p>Microcode is a computer hardware technique that interposes a layer of organisation between the CPU hardware and the programmer-visible instruction set architecture of the computer. As such, the microcode is a layer of hardware-level instructions that implement higher-level machine code instructions or internal state machine sequencing in many digital processing elements.</p>
            <p> I received 98% on my implementation of a Microcoded Instruction Set Processor. This processor can perform basic arithmetic, logic and shifting operations as well as conditional and unconditional branching. Users can enter their machine code into memory and the micro-controller will perform these instructions.</p>
