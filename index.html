        <h2 class="about_subtitle">Computer Science student and Software Engineer</h2>
        <div class="about_body">
          <p class="about_text">I am an ambitious Computer Science student in Trinity College Dublin with professional experience as a
            Software Engineering Development Intern at Amazon Web Services (AWS).<br/>Studying Computer
            Science has allowed me to marry my interests in technology, problem-solving and innovation. I am
            particularly interested in pursuing a career in machine learning in the future and I have
            completed many software engineering projects in my spare time.<br/>I was selected as one of 36
            Naughton Foundation scholars nationwide in 2018. This scholarship is worth â‚¬20,000 and is awarded
            on the basis of demonstrated leadership skills and academic success in the Leaving Certificate. The Naughton
            Foundation scholarship was established to encourage young people to study STEM subjects in
            universities throughout Ireland.<br/>In 2017, I won the National Rotary Youth Leadership Development
            Competition. This competition recognises leadership potential in young people and is conducted
            through a series of intense interviews, covering topics such as immigration and climate change.
            In the same year, I served as an Irish Youth Delegate to the European Parliament at a Euroscola
            event, where I was elected spokesperson for Climate Action and Green Energy.</p>

        <h1 class="project_title">AI for Flappy Bird</h1>
        <div class="project_body">
          <p class="project_text_beside">Machine learning is an area of computer science that fascinates me. Unfortunately, my university
            does not offer any courses in this area until fourth year. I simply could not wait until then, so I
            decided to create this project!<br/>This project uses NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)
            to train the AI clients. On simple tasks, the NEAT algorithm often arrives at effective networks more
            quickly than other contemporary neuro-evolutionary techniques and reinforcement learning modules.
            <br/>This project is written in Python and uses the pygame module
            to recreate the Flappy Bird game environment. The AI client uses the python-neat module to create
            the neural networks that play the game.<br/>

        <h1 class="project_title">Sorting Visualiser</h1>
        <div class="project_body">
          <p class="project_text">After completing my Algorithms and Data Structures module in college, I wanted to deepen
            my understanding of the algorithms that we had studied. I also wanted to explore new front-end technologies to broaden
            web-development skills. Making this sorting visualiser allowed me to kill both of those birds with the one stone!<br />
            This project visualises 6 sorting algorithms, Quick sort, Merge sort, Tim sort, Insertion sort, Selection sort and Bubble sort.
            <br/>This project was my first venture into the React.js framework. I am glad to have added React.js to my
            tool-belt and I am excited to work on more visually appealing web applications in the future.

        <h1 class="project_title">Rubik's Cube Visualiser</h1>
        <div class="project_body">
          <p class="project_text_beside">I have been obsessed with Rubik's cubes ever since I was a child. My
            record is around 19 seconds for a single solve. It is not always practical to bring my
            Rubik's cube around with me, so I decided to make a digital one that I will always have on me!<br />
            This project uses Processing, a programming language that is based on Java with a focus on visualisation.
            Users can scramble the cube and attempt to solve it themselves. If they ever get stuck, they can just
            press the space bar and watch the puzzle solve itself before their very eyes.

        <div class="project_body">
          <p class="project_text_beside">This assignment was worth 70% of my overall grade in my Computer Architecture 1 module in college. I received a grade
            of 98% on this VHDL implementation. This project simulates a microcoded instruction set processor that can perform arithmetic,
            logic and shifting operations, as well as conditional/unconditional branching by reading in user-provided machine code from memory.
            <br />All of the components that are used in this project have test-benches associated with them to ensure functionality is correct.
